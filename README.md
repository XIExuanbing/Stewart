# Stewart
This repository is for describing Stewart measurement and control system, which aims to achieve position control based on STM32 and simplify reproducible mechanical design and physical debugging.

This is my full-stack project, a parallel robot from mechanical design to assembly, to hardware circuit design, and finally control code writing. This platform costs only 200 yuan, is completely self-made, uses robot forward and inverse kinematics, and is easy to get started
